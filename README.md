# Analysis of Sea Ice Concentration Anomaly Data Using Correlation Based Graph
Arctic sea-ice levels are a proxy indicator of climate change and a lot of research is being conducted on this topic. Our aim is to analyze the longest continuous satellite record of sea-ice records from the data obtained from the meteorological satellites. The analysis presented in this report is conducted on the anomaly dataset comprising sea ice concentration (SIC), which spans 27 years.

In this project, the anomaly data set is analysed to find if it is a small world network. To accomplish this, the following parameters are calculated:
1. Mean Clustering Coefficient of the Graph
2. Characteristic path length of the Graph (L)
3. Comparison with a Random Graph of the same size

Programming Environment: MATLAB
